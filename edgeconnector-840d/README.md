# dataFEED edgeConnector 840D

SoftingÂ´s dataFEED edgeConnector 840D is a containerized connectivity module adding OPC UA Server functionality.

It is possible to connect up to 5 Siemens SINUMERIK 840D SL/PL devices.

## Supported Operating Systems

dataFEED edgeConnector 840D can be used on any Docker host that can execute Linux Docker containers based on an x86_64 architecture.

## Default Settings

The default settings are described in the [Default Settings](../common/defaults.md) chapter.

## Physical Connection to SINUMERIK 840D Controller

The different SINUMERIK 840D variants provide different physical connection types.
SINUMERIK 840D SL offers access by Ethernet interfaces. And SINUMERIK 840D PL offers only MPI access.

## Physical Connection to SINUMERIK 840D SL

SINUMERIK 840D SL has 3 Ethernet interfaces:
  1. **X120** for the device connection to HMIs and keyboards
  2. **X130** for the company network
  3. **X127** for service purposes

![Interface Overview](../documentation_pics/OPCUA_activate_006.png)

![Network Configuration](../documentation_pics/OPCUA_activate_009.png)

dataFEED edgeConnector 840D uses the S7 Communication (TCP/102) protocol of SINUMERIK 840D SL.
This protocol is by default available at interface **X120** and could be enabled for interface **X130**.

Thus, the host PC, which should run dataFEED edgeConnector 840D needs either
  - a physical connection to the interface **X120** and an unique IPv4 address within the corresponding network
  - or a physical connection to the interface **X130**, an unique IPv4 address within the corresponding network and the S7 communication protocol explicitly enabled for this interface.

## Physical Connection to SINUMERIK 840D PL

SINUMERIK 840D PL provides two MPI interfaces for communication.
Therefore an Ethernet to MPI converter is needed.

The Ethernet to MPI converter translates the RFC-1006 TSAP addresses into MPI addresses.
So the default MPI addresses of SINUMERIK 840D PL are translated into the following TSAP settings:

  - TSAP NCK (powerline): `03 03`
  - TSAP PLC (powerline): `03 02`

## Running dataFEED edgeConnector 840D

In order to run dataFEED edgeConnector 840D a working Docker environment is required.
For Docker installation instructions please refer to the [official Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Pulling the image

The Docker images are provided through a public registry.
To get the latest Docker image you need to pull the image from [https://hub.docker.com/r/softingindustrial/](https://hub.docker.com/r/softingindustrial/):.
```bash
docker image pull softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens:latest
```

### Run the Docker container

After the Docker image has been pulled, a Docker container can be started.
The webserver and OPC UA Server of the module have to be exposed on the host machine if the dataFEED edgeConnector modules shall be accessed from outside the dockerized environment.

To start dataFEED edgeConnector 840D with the default ports mapped 1:1 to the host machine:
```bash
docker container run -p 443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4897:4897 softingindustrial/edgeconnector-840d
```
The above example can be adapted to match the needs of your environment.
For example, if your host already runs a webserver and the https port is blocked, the command can be adjusted to expose the https port of dataFEED edgeConnector 840D on a different port:

```bash
docker container run -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4897:4897 softingindustrial/edgeconnector-840d
```
The `-p` switch allows to map a complete port range `start-end:start-end`, the `-d` switch allows to daemonize the container and the `--name` switch allows to name the container:  

```bash
docker container run -d -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4800-4900:4800-4900 --name edgeConnector softingindustrial/edgeconnector-840d
```
For further information about supported command line options please refer to the [official Docker command line documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)

### Stop the Docker container

The module container can be stopped by the following command:
```bash
docker container stop edgeConnector
```
Please refer to the [official Docker command line documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_stop/) for more details.

### Start the Docker container
If the module container was stopped and not removed, it can be started again from its last state:
```bash
docker container start edgeConnector
```
Please refer to the [official Docker command line documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_start/) for more details.


### Remove the Docker container

The module container can be removed at any time:
```bash
docker container rm -f edgeConnector
```
After removing the container its last state is lost.
Please refer to the [official Docker command line documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_rm/) for more details.

### Configuration Volume

Optionally a Docker volume to store the configuration permanently could be created:

```bash
docker volume create edge-connector-config
```

In this case the container should be started like this, using the volume:

```bash
docker container run -d -v edge-connector-config:/config -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4800-4900:4800-4900 --name edgeConnector softingindustrial/edgeconnector-840d
```

## Configuration

The configuration part, which is common for all kinds of dataFEED edgeConnector modules is described in the [Configuration](../common/configuration.md) chapter.

### Siemens SINUMERIK 840D cConnection Configuration

#### PLC Address Space Configuration by SDFI File

The symbolic names of the PLC S7 data need to be provided in an `*.sdfi` file.
You can generate the `*.SDFI` file with the Softing dataFEED Exporter tool.
This tool uses the STEP7 or TIA Portal project files as input and allows you to select one PLC S7 to generate the `*.SDFI` file which contains the symbol definition.
Proceed as follows to convert and import symbol files:
	1. Download [dataFEED Exporter](https://data-intelligence.softing.com/products/iot-gateways/datafeed-exporter/#tx-dftabs-tabContent2) to that PC where the PLC configuration software (STEP7 or TIA Portal V13) is installed.
	2. Execute the installation file and follow the instructions from the installation wizard.
	3. Run dataFEED Exporter.
	4. Follow thedataFEED Exporter  instructions to load and convert your STEP7 or TIA Portal symbol files.
	5. Save the converted `*.SDFI` file to your PC.
	6. Upload the `*.SDFI` file within the [Siemens SINUMERIK 840D connection configuration](#siemens-sinumerik-840d-connection-configuration).

#### NCK Address Space definition by awl file

The creation of `.awl` files is described in ![uaGate840D_AdditionalVariables_C_EN_190801_L_100.pdf](uaGate840D_AdditionalVariables_C_EN_190801_L_100.pdf).
