# dataFEED edgeConnector 840D

SoftingÂ´s dataFEED edgeConnector 840D is a containerized connectivity module adding OPC UA Server functionality.

It is possible to connect up to 5 Siemens SINUMERIK 840D SL/PL devices.

## Supported Operating Systems

Any Docker host that can execute Linux Docker containers based on an x86_64 architecture.

## Defaults

The default settings are described in [defaults.md](../common/defaults.md).

## Physical Connection to 840D device

The different 840D variants provide different physical connection types.
The 840D SL offers access by Ethernet interfaces. And the 840D PL offers only MPI access.

## Physical Connection to 840D SL

The 840D SL has 3 Ethernet interfaces:
  1. **X120** for the device connection to HMIs and keyboards.
  2. **X130** for the company network.
  3. **X127** for service purposes.

![Interface overview](../documentation_pics/OPCUA_activate_006.png)

![Network configuration](../documentation_pics/OPCUA_activate_009.png)

The dataFEED edgeConnector 840D uses the S7 Communication (TCP/102) protocol of the 840D SL.
This protocol is by default available at interface **X120** and could be enabled for interface **X130**.

So the host PC, which should run the dataFEED edgeConnector 840D needs either
  - a physical connection to the interface **X120** and an unique IPv4 address within the corresponding network
  - or a physical connection to the interface **X130**, an unique IPv4 address within the corresponding network and S7 communication protocol explicitly enabled for this interface.

## Physical Connection to 840D PL

The 840D PL provides two MPI interfaces for communication.
Therefore an Ethernet to MPI converter is needed.

The Ethernet to MPI converter translates the RFC-1006 TSAP addresses into MPI addresses.
So the default MPI addresses of the 840D PL are translated into the following TSAP settings:

  - TSAP NCK (powerline): `03 03`
  - TSAP PLC (powerline): `03 02`

## Running dataFEED edgeConnector Modules

In order to run the dataFEED edgeConnector modules a working Docker environment is required.
For Docker installation instructions please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Pulling the image

The Docker images are provided through a public registry.
To get the latest Docker image you need to login to the Docker registry and pull the image.
```bash
docker image pull softingindustrial/edgeconnector-840d:latest
```

### Run the Docker container

After the Docker image has been pulled, a Docker container can be started.
The web server and OPC UA Server of the module have to be exposed on the host machine if the dataFEED edgeConnectors shall be accessed from outside the dockerized environment.

To start the dataFEED edgeConnector 840D with the default ports mapped 1:1 to the host machine:
```bash
docker container run -p 443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4897:4897 softingindustrial/edgeconnector-840d
```
The above example can be adapted to match the needs of your environment. For example if your host already runs a webserver and the https port is blocked, the command can be adjusted to expose the https port of dataFEED edgeConnector module on a different port.

```bash
docker container run -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4897:4897 softingindustrial/edgeconnector-840d
```
To map a complete port range use the `-p` switch with a range `start-end:start-end`.  
To daemonize the container use the `-d` switch.  
To name the container use the `--name` switch.  
```bash
docker container run -d -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4800-4900:4800-4900 --name edgeConnector softingindustrial/edgeconnector-840d
```
For further information about supported commandline options please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)

### Stop the Docker container

The module container can be stopped by the following command:
```bash
docker container stop edgeConnector
```
Please refer to [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_stop/) for more details.

### Start the Docker container
If the module container was stopped and not removed, it can be started again from its last state.
```bash
docker container start edgeConnector
```
Please refer to [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_start/) for more details.


### Remove the Docker container

The module container can be removed at any time. After removing the container its last state is lost.
```bash
docker container rm -f edgeConnector
```
Please refer to [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_rm/) for more details.

### Configuration Volume

Optionally a Docker volume to store the configuration permanently could be created:

```bash
docker volume create edge-connector-config
```

In this case the container should be started like this, to use the volume:

```bash
docker container run -d -v edge-connector-config:/config -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4800-4900:4800-4900 --name edgeConnector softingindustrial/edgeconnector-840d
```

## Configuration

The configuration part, which is common for all kinds of dataFEED edgeConnector modules is described in [configuration.md](../common/configuration.md).

### Siemens SINUMERIK 840D connection configuration

dataFEED edgeConnector 840D provides an interface to connect and fetch data from the Siemens SINUMERIK 840D series.

To configure a Siemens SINUMERIK 840D connection, navigate to **Connectivity -> PLC -> Siemens SINUMERIK 840D** as depicted in the navigation tree below:

![sinumerik 840d_navigation](../documentation_pics/s840d_navigation.png)

The page provides an overview of the currently configured connections including the **Name**, the **IP address**, the connection **NCK Status**, the **PLC Status** and the **Enabled** state.  
![sinumerik 840d_overview](../documentation_pics/s840d_overview.png)  


| Column Name | Information Details |
| :-- | :-- |
| Name | Connection name as defined at creation time. |
| IP Address | IP Address or host name of the PLC |
| Status NCK | Describes the state of the NCK connection. The connection state can be `Connected` if the connection to the NCK is established; `Disconnected` if there is no connection to the NCK or it could be `Disabled` if the connection to the NCK was not configured for this entry. The connection status is dynamically updated every 2 seconds. |
| Status PLC | State of the PLC connection. The connection state can be `Connected` if the connection to the PLC is established; `Disconnected` if there is no connection to the PLC or it could be `Disabled` if the connection to the PLC was not configured for this entry. The connection status is dynamically updated every 2 seconds. |
| Enabled | Configuration state of the PLC connection. Possible values are `Enabled` or `Disabled`. <br>Note: Clicking on the current configuration state icon would trigger a state toggle: Enabled -> Disabled; Disabled -> Enabled. <br>When in Disabled state both the NCK and PLC connections are disabled. When Enabled only the connection types initially configured for this connection are enabled. |

From the title bar of the connection overview table a new connection can be added and existing connections can be either edited or deleted.  

- To add a new connection click the ![add_connection](../documentation_pics/add_connection.png) button.  
- To edit an existing connection, first select it from the overview table and click the ![edit_connection](../documentation_pics/edit_connection.png) button.  
- To delete an existing connection, first select it from the overview table and click the ![delete_connection](../documentation_pics/delete_connection.png) button.  

Adding a new connection and editing an existing connection, each open the same page. The only difference is, that for an existing connection the **Connection Name** property can not be changed.

#### PLC Address Space Configuration by SDFI File

The symbolic names of the PLC S7 data need to be provided in an `*.sdfi` file.
You can generate the `*.sdfi` file with the Softing dataFEED Exporter tool.
This tool uses the S7 TIA project files as input and allows you to select one PLC S7 to generate the `*.sdfi` file which contains the symbol definition.
Proceed as follows to convert and import symbol files:
	1. Download the [dataFEED Exporter](https://data-intelligence.softing.com/products/iot-gateways/datafeed-exporter/#tx-dftabs-tabContent2) to that PC where the PLC configuration software (Step7 or TIAv13) is installed.
	2. Execute the installation file and follow the instructions from the installation wizard.
	3. Run the dataFEED Exporter.
	4. Follow the instructions from the dataFEED Exporter tool to load and convert your Step7 symbol files.
	5. Save the converted `*.sdfi` file to your PC.
	6. Upload the `*.sdfi` file within the [Siemens SINUMERIK 840D connection configuration](#siemens-sinumerik-840d-connection-configuration).
