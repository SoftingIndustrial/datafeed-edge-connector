# PMC Syntax

For the import of the PMC variables, the export files generated by the program `FANUC Ladder III` can be used.

Each line defining a PMC variable needs to match the following syntax:

```
<Variable name>,<PMC address>,<comment1>,<comment2><cr><lf>
```

Where

- `<Variable name>`: Is the name of the variable (letters and digits)
- `,`: Is the separator. Therefore this character must not be used within any name or comment
- `<PMC address>`: Is the address of the PMC variable, with the following syntax:
   `[<unit>]<area><start address>[.<bit number>]`
    - `<unit>`: An optional digit defining the unit. If omitted the unit is 1.
    - `<area>`: A letter from the set [GFXYARTKCDMNEZ], defining the PMC area
    - `<start address>`: The address within the PMC area
    - `.<bit number>`: An optional bit number, seperated by a dot (only for Boolean values)
- `<comment1>` and `<comment2>`: are optionally comments
- `<cr><lf>`: Are the carriage-return and line-feed characters, ending the line.
