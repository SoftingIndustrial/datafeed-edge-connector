# dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens

SoftingÂ´s dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens is a containerized SIMATIC S7 connectivity module adding OPC UA Server functionality.

It is possible to connect up to 20 Siemens S7-1200 or S7-1500 PLCs including optimized data blocks.
The namespace configuration is done by browsing SIMATIC STEP 7 and TIA Portal variables.  

## Supported Operating Systems

dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens can be used on any Docker host that can execute Linux Docker containers based on an x86_64 architecture.

## Default Settings

The default settings are described in the [Default Settings](../common/defaults.md) chapter.

## Running dataFEED edgeConnector Modules

In order to run dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens a working Docker environment is required.
For Docker installation instructions please refer to the [official Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Pulling the image

The Docker images are provided through a public registry.
To get the latest Docker image you need to pull the image from [https://hub.docker.com/r/softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens](https://hub.docker.com/r/softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens):
```bash
docker image pull softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens:latest
```

### Run the Docker container

After the Docker image has been pulled, a Docker container can be started.
The webserver and OPC UA Server of the module have to be exposed on the host machine if the dataFEED edgeConnector modules shall be accessed from outside the dockerized environment.

To start dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens with the default ports mapped 1:1 to the host machine:
```bash
docker container run -p 443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4897:4897 softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens
```
The above example can be adapted to match the needs of your environment.
For example, if your host already runs a webserver and the https port is blocked, the command can be adjusted to expose the https port of the dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens on a different port:

```bash
docker container run -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4897:4897 softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens
```
The `-p` switch allows to map a complete port range `start-end:start-end`, the `-d` switch allows to daemonize the container and the `--name` switch allows to name the container:  

```bash
docker container run -d -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4800-4900:4800-4900 --name edgeConnector softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens
```
For further information about supported command line options please refer to the [official Docker command line documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)

### Stop the Docker container

The module container can be stopped by the following command:
```bash
docker container stop edgeConnector
```
Please refer to the [official Docker command line documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_stop/) for more details.

### Start the Docker container
If the module container was stopped and not removed, it can be started again from its last state:
```bash
docker container start edgeConnector
```
Please refer to the [official Docker command line documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_start/) for more details.


### Remove the Docker container

The module container can be removed at any time:
```bash
docker container rm -f edgeConnector
```
After removing the container its last state is lost.
Please refer to the [official Docker command line documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_rm/) for more details.

### Configuration Volume

Optionally a Docker volume to store the configuration permanently could be created:

```bash
docker volume create edge-connector-config
```

In this case the container should be started like this, using the volume:

```bash
docker container run -d -v edge-connector-config:/config -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4800-4900:4800-4900 --name edgeConnector softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens
```

## Configuration

The configuration part, which is common for all kinds of dataFEED edgeConnector modules is described in the [Configuration](../common/configuration.md) chapter.

### Siemens S7 1200/1500 connection configuration

dataFEED edgeConnnector Siemens provides an interface to connect and fetch data from a Siemens S7 1200 or 1500 series PLC.

To configure a connection to a Siemens S7 1200 or S7 1500 PLC, navigate to **Connectivity -> PLC -> Siemens S7 1200/1500** as depicted in the navigation tree below:

![s7_navigation](../documentation_pics/s7_navigation.png)

The page provides an overview of the currently configured connections including the **Name**, the **IP Address**, the connection **Status** and the **Enabled** state.
![s7_overview](../documentation_pics/s7_overview.png)

| Column Name | Information Details |
| :-- | :-- |
| Name | Connection name as defined at creation time|
| IP Address | IP address or host name of the PLC |
| Status | State of the PLC connection, either<br>Connected if the connection to the PLC is established or Disconnected if there is no connection to the PLC<br>The connection status is dynamically updated every 2 seconds. |
| Enabled | Configuration state of the PLC connection<br>Possible values are `Enabled` or `Disabled`.<br>Note: Clicking on the current configuration state icon trigger a state toggle: Enabled -> Disabled; Disabled -> Enabled |

From the title bar of the connection overview table a new connection can be added and existing connections can be either edited or deleted.  

- To add a new connection click the ![Add Connection](../documentation_pics/add_connection.png) button.  
- To edit an existing connection, first select it from the overview table and click the ![Edit Connection](../documentation_pics/edit_connection.png) button. 
- To delete an existing connection, first select it from the overview table and click the ![Delete Connection](../documentation_pics/delete_connection.png) button.  

Adding a new connection and editing an existing connection, both open an identical page. The only difference is, that for an existing connection the **Connection Name** property cannot be changed.  
![s71200-1500_connection_settings_basic](../documentation_pics/s7_connection_settings_basic.png)

The configuration parameters are described below:

| Parameter Name        | Default Value                 | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Connection Name       | <empty>                         | Connection name as it will show up in the connection overview page<br>It must be unique and can only be assigned when adding a new connection.<br>Note: The following characters are not supported in this field:  **# ^ < > / $** |
| Enabled               | Enabled                       | Instructs dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens to either enable (checked) or disable (unchecked) the currently configured PLC connection. |
| PLC Address           | <empty>                         | Address of the target device (S7 1200/1500 PLC)<br>This is either an IP address or a hostname. |
| Select Address Spaces | AllConnection<br>AddressSpace | Destination aggregation address space used to store the address space corresponding to this PLC connection.<br>It is possible to create additional aggregation address spaces by filling in the desired address space name in the input field and clicking the **Add** button. All available address spaces are visible in a list and can be selected as destination address space for the OPC UA Client connection by checking the corresponding checkbox.<br>For more details about the OPC UA Server functionality and configuration please refer to the [OPC UA Configuration](../common/opcua.md) documentation. |

## Simulation Mode

The edgeConnector Siemens supports simulation mode for the S7 1200/1500 controller, which means that it provides a few ways of automatically generating tag values in a similarly structured standard address space as a real PLC. All UA services are supported as for a real PLC, Browse, Subscribe, Read and Write.

The available value simulation types are Random, Incremental (increasing to the data type's maximum, then starting from its minimum again), Sawtooth (increasing to the maximum and after reaching it decreasing to its minimum, then increasing again, and so on) and Waveform with anomalies (a Sine wave form of generating data, periodically adding a random anomaly). These simulation types are supported only for the basic data types and arrays of these data types, currently.

The mapping of these simulation types to the different basic data types is as follows:
- Boolean: Random
- SByte: Sawtooth
- Byte: Sawtooth
- Int16: Incremental
- UInt16: Random
- Int32: Incremental
- UInt32: Incremental
- Int64: Random
- UInt64: Random
- Float: Waveform (250 ms update rate; min = -50, max = 50; contains anomalies)
- Double: Waveform (500 ms update rate, min = -500, max = 500; does not contain anomalies)
- String: Random (length of 10; containing alphanumeric, '_' and '-' characters)
- DateTime: Random (between 1970 and 2100)

Notes:
- Where it is not specified, the update rate is 1000 milliseconds
- The minimum and maximum values for all numerical data types (except where specified otherwise) are their corresponding values (e.g. SByte: between -128 and 127)
- Floating point data types are restricted as specified above for more practical visualization purposes

Limitations:
- Currently, there is no customization options regarding neither the type of simulation used for a data type or tag, nor the parameters of the simulation types
- The value generation process cannot be stopped when a simulated connection is enabled; this means that when writing to a tag the written value will be lost at the next data change, because the simulation will generate a new data value. In case of Incremental and Sawtooth simulation types the next value will depend on the written value

### Configuration of a simulated connection

For adding a connection which starts in Simulation mode the following steps are necessary:
- To add a new simulated connection click the ![add_connection](../documentation_pics/add_connection.png) button.  
- Enter a unique name in the **Connection Name** field
- Go to the **Advanced Settings** tab on the same page
- At the bottom check the **Simulation** check box
- Switch back to the **Connection Settings** page
- Press the **Save** button

After a short time the simulator will start generating values for that connection, which can be browsed and monitored with a client application by subscribing to some tags with the above mentioned data types.

Also, the **Address Spaces** section will show a new node with the name of the new simulated connection, which can be browsed and filtered from that moment on.

Other notes and restrictions:
- A simulated connection cannot be edited in any way after it has been added, none of its settings can be changed. All the fields are disabled after pressing the **Save** button
- Such a connection can only be deleted using the ![delete_connection](../documentation_pics/delete_connection.png) button  
- Any number of simulated connections can be added, but their address space will look the same, they are derived from the same standard PLC address space
- All simulated connections are subject to the general licensing mechanisms, so they will use a license when added, and yield it back when deleted
- A simulated connection cannot get out of Simulation mode, nor can a real PLC connection be changed to Simulation mode

When visualizing one of each of the simulation types, it may look like this:
