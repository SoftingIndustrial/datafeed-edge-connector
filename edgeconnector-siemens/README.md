# **dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens**

SoftingÂ´s **dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens** is a containerized SIMATIC S7
connectivity module adding OPC UA Server functionality.

It is possible to connect up to 20 SIMATIC S7-1200 or S7-1500 PLCs including
optimized data blocks.
The namespace configuration is done by browsing SIMATIC STEP 7 and TIA Portal
variables.  

## Supported Operating Systems

**dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens** can be used on any Docker host that can
execute Linux Docker containers based on an x86_64 architecture.

## Default Settings

The default settings are described at the [Default Settings page](../common/defaults.md).

## Running **dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens**

In order to run **dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens** a working Docker environment
is required.
For Docker installation instructions please refer to the
[official Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Pulling the Image

The Docker images are provided through a public registry.
To get the latest Docker image you need to pull the image from
[https://hub.docker.com/r/softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens](https://hub.docker.com/r/softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens):

```bash
docker image pull softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens:latest
```

### Running the Docker Container

After the Docker image has been pulled, a Docker container can be started.
The webserver and OPC UA Server of the module have to be exposed on the host
machine if **dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens** shall be accessed from outside
the dockerized environment.

To start **dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens** with the default ports mapped 1:1
to the host machine:

```bash
docker container run -p 443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4897:4897 softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens
```

The above example can be adapted to match the needs of your environment.
For example, if your host already runs a webserver and the https port is
blocked, the command can be adjusted to expose the https port of **dataFEED
edgeConnector Siemens** on a different port:

```bash
docker container run -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4897:4897 softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens
```

The `-p` switch allows to map a complete port range `start-end:start-end`,
the `-d` switch allows to daemonize the container and the `--name` switch
allows to name the container:  

```bash
docker container run -d -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4800-4900:4800-4900 --name edgeConnector softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens
```

#### Running with specified timezone
The `-e` or `--env` switch allows to set environment variables in the container.
For setting a timezone the variable `TZ` must be passed with a valid `TZ database name`.

```bash
docker container run -d -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4800-4900:4800-4900 --name edgeConnector -e TZ=Europe/Berlin softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens
```

For further information about supported command line options please refer to the
[Run section](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) of the
official Docker command line documentation.

### Stopping the Docker Container

The module container can be stopped by the following command:

```bash
docker container stop edgeConnector
```

Please refer to the
[Stop section](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_stop/)
of the official Docker command line documentation for more details.

### Starting the Docker Container

If the module container was stopped and not removed, it can be started again
from its last state:

```bash
docker container start edgeConnector
```

Please refer to the
[Start section](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_start/)
of the official Docker command line documentation for more details.

### Removing the Docker Container

The module container can be removed at any time:

```bash
docker container rm -f edgeConnector
```

After removing the container its last state is lost.
Please refer to the
[Remove section](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_rm/)
of the official Docker command line documentation for more details.

### Configuration Volume

Optionally a Docker volume can be created to store the configuration permanently:

```bash
docker volume create edge-connector-config
```

In this case the container should be started like this, using the volume:

```bash
docker container run -d -v edge-connector-config:/config -p 1443:443 -p 8099:8099 -p 4800-4900:4800-4900 --name edgeConnector softingindustrial/edgeconnector-siemens
```

## Simulation Mode

The edgeConnector Siemens supports simulation mode for the S7 1200/1500
controller, which means that it provides a few ways of automatically generating
tag values in a similarly structured standard address space as a real PLC. All
UA services are supported as for a real PLC, Browse, Subscribe, Read and Write.

The available value simulation types are Random, Incremental (increasing to the
data type's maximum, then starting from its minimum again), Sawtooth (increasing
to the maximum and after reaching it decreasing to its minimum, then increasing
again, and so on) and Waveform with anomalies (a Sine wave form of generating
data, periodically adding a random anomaly). These simulation types are supported
only for the basic data types and arrays of these data types, currently.

The mapping of these simulation types to the different basic data types is as follows:

- Boolean: Random
- SByte: Sawtooth
- Byte: Sawtooth
- Int16: Incremental
- UInt16: Random
- Int32: Incremental
- UInt32: Incremental
- Int64: Random
- UInt64: Random
- Float: Waveform (250 ms update rate; min = -50, max = 50; contains anomalies)
- Double: Waveform (500 ms update rate, min = -500, max = 500; does not contain
anomalies)
- String: Random (length of 10; containing alphanumeric, '_' and '-' characters)
- DateTime: Random (between 1970 and 2100)

Notes:

- Where it is not specified, the update rate is 1000 milliseconds
- The minimum and maximum values for all numerical data types (except where
  specified otherwise) are their corresponding values (e.g. SByte: between -128
  and 127)
- Floating point data types are restricted as specified above for more practical
  visualization purposes

Limitations:

- Currently, there is no customization options regarding neither the type of
  simulation used for a data type or tag, nor the parameters of the simulation
  types
- The value generation process cannot be stopped when a simulated connection
  is enabled; this means that when writing to a tag the written value will be
  lost at the next data change, because the simulation will generate a new data
  value. In case of Incremental and Sawtooth simulation types the next value
  will depend on the written value

### Configuration of a simulated connection

For adding a connection which starts in Simulation mode the following steps
are necessary:

- To add a new simulated connection click the
  ![add_connection](../documentation_pics/add_connection.png) button.  
- Enter a unique name in the **Connection Name** field
- Go to the **Advanced Settings** tab on the same page
- At the bottom check the **Simulation** check box
- Switch back to the **Connection Settings** page
- Press the **Save** button

After a short time the simulator will start generating values for that
connection, which can be browsed and monitored with a client application
by subscribing to some tags with the above mentioned data types.

Also, the **Address Spaces** section will show a new node with the name of
the new simulated connection, which can be browsed and filtered from that
moment on.

Other notes and restrictions:

- A simulated connection cannot be edited in any way after it has been added,
  none of its settings can be changed. All the fields are disabled after
  pressing the **Save** button
- Such a connection can only be deleted using the
![delete_connection](../documentation_pics/delete_connection.png) button  
- Any number of simulated connections can be added, but their address space
  will look the same, they are derived from the same standard PLC address space
- All simulated connections are subject to the general licensing mechanisms,
  so they will use a license when added, and yield it back when deleted
- A simulated connection cannot get out of Simulation mode, nor can a real
  PLC connection be changed to Simulation mode

When visualizing one of each of the simulation types, it may look like this:
